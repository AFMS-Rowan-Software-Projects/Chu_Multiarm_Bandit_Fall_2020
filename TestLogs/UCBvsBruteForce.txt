Testing the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm against the Brute Force algorithm, within a 
controlled environment in whichthe channels all have the same stay failure rate, but only 
slightly different rates of stay success rate. This set of channelswas ran across both 
algorithms 1000 times in order to gauge how often each algorithm selected the best channels, 
or close to the best channel

Rigged 10 Channel environment, ran for 1000 Trials

Channel 0:	Stay Success:  0.46	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 1:	Stay Success:  0.47	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 2:	Stay Success:  0.48	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 3:	Stay Success:  0.49	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 4:	Stay Success:  0.50	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 5:	Stay Success:  0.51	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 6:	Stay Success:  0.52	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 7:	Stay Success:  0.53	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 8:	Stay Success:  0.54	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 9:	Stay Success:  0.55	Stay Failure:  0.5

Results:
Numbers next to Channel #: are out times chosen out of 1000 runs

		Upper Confidence Bound				Brute Force
Channel 9: 		423					170
Channel 8: 		269					150
Channel 7: 		154					127
Channel 6: 		72					114
Channel 5: 		45					101
Channel 4: 		21					96
Channel 3: 		10					78
Channel 2: 		4					67
Channel 1: 		2					50
Channel 0:		0					47

When comparing the results of the two algorithms we can see that the Upper Confidence Bound did a
much better job at identifying the more successful channels than what the Brute Force Algorithm
identified. 

For the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm out of 1000 runs it identified the best channel as one of
the top 5 channels 96.3% of the time, in comparison the Brute Force identified the best channel as one 
of the top 5 only 66.2% of the time.

While the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm was not perfect in identifying the single best individual
channel, this test does demonstrate that it would be more successful in identifying a proper subset of channels
for use, at a much more successful rate than the Brute Force Algorithm would.
