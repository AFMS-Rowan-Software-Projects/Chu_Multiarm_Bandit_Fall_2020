Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm has now been implemented, the algorithm initially will explore 
each channel in order to gain initial information, then it will decide which channel to explore 
based on how they are uncertain about a channels outcome, if there is still uncertainty about
the channel, it will be chosen again until it below a threshold. UCB is an optimistic algorithm,
if we are uncertain about a channel, we should assume that it could be the correct channel.

Rigged 2 Channel environment, Channel 0 has a much higher chance of success than
Channel 1, ran for 25 trials

It is intended that Channel 0 will be selected, 
Channel 0 chance of staying in success state is 95%
Channel 0 chance of staying in failure state is 5%
Channel 1 chance of staying in success state is 5%
Channel 1 chance of staying in failure state is 95%

Results:
Best Channel was found to be Channel 0,
with a final success rate of 95.83%

Overall, the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm was successful in differentiating the between the two
rigged channels, and easily selected the optimal channel out of the two.
