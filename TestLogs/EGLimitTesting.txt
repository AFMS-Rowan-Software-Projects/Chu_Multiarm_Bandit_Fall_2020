Testing the Limits of the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm on a 32 Channel environment, 
Stay Success rate is in between 74-76% whilst the Stay Failure rate is in between 71-73%.
This is the same set of data that was used for the UCB Limit Testing.

My expectation is that the data set is too close together, and that the algorithm will not be able
to identify a best channel due to the similarities of the channels, and that the algorithm has been
Limited to 3200 trials for this run.

Due to the nature of how the epsilon greedy algorithm first finds a group of channels and then
branches out afterwards we see that due to the channels values being so close to one another that
the algorithm simply favored the channels that were explored first, because there were never any channels that stood out clearly to be better from the start, so the algorithm continued to exploit the beginning channels instead of continuing to explore the others
