Naive algorithm has now been implemented, it is designed to ping each channel 100 times
and whichever channel returns the most successful acknowledgements back should be exclusively
chosen.

Rigged 2 Channel environment, Channel 0 has a much higher chance of success than
Channel 1

It is intended that Channel 0 will be selected, 
Channel 0 chance of staying in success state is 95%
Channel 0 chance of staying in failure state is 5%
Channel 1 chance of staying in success state is 5%
Channel 1 chance of staying in failure state is 95%

Results:
Best Channel was found to be Channel 0,
with a final success rate of 96%

Overall, the naive algorithm was successful in differentiating between the two options at hand,
Channel 0 was clearly the better choice and the algorithm successfully identified it as such.
