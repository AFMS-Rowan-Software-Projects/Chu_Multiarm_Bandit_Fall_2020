Originally, I had run Epsilon Greedy Limit Testing on this set of data allowing the algorithm 3200 runs to make its decision, and I found that it struggled to properly differentiate the best channels from
the worst, so I increased the amount of trials allowed for the algorithm ten fold, allowing for
32000 pings of the channels to see how much the decisions improved by

This test showed that when given more trials, the algorithms decision will still struggle to 
deviate from its initial subset of channels. When the channels are this similar epsilon greedy tends
to exploit the channels it identified as the best early on, and tends to not deviate from that

Overall, I donâ€™t think the Epsilon Greedy algorithm does a very good job at identifying the best 
Channel because of how early on it fixates on a best channel, and in doing so tends to not explore
Similar channels because they are not that much different from one another. Surprisingly, with
an increase in trials it seems that Epsilon Greedy failed to deviate from its original decision even
more than it had previously
