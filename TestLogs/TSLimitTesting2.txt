Originally, I had run Thompson Sampling Limit Testing on this set of data allowing the algorithm 3200 runs to make its decision, and I found that it struggled to properly differentiate the best channels from
the worst, so I increased the amount of trials allowed for the algorithm ten fold, allowing for
32000 pings of the channels to see how much the decisions improved by

This test showed that when given more trials, the algorithms decision will come result in a 
Larger spread, before the best channel was only selected 46 times out of 1000, this time the
best channel was selected 101 times. Additionally, the differences in the averages between
TOP 3 and BOT 3 SS and SF both were improved with the additional trial runs. The drawback was that with the increased amount of trials increased the time, the runs with 3200 trials took 284 seconds, whereas with 32000 trials the runs took 899 seconds.

TOP 3 SS AVG = 0.754556672387906
BOT 3 SS AVG = 0.744218787053552
DIFF: Top 3 + 0.010337885334354

TOP 3 SF AVG = 0.716146714994654
BOT 3 SF AVG = 0.7261543962394459
DIFF: Top 3 - 0.010007681244805

Overall, the algorithm clearly is able to differentiate these channels to some degree even
when the probabilities on each of the channels failure and success rate is so close together.
The drawback of this algorithm is that it takes a good amount longer than the other two algorithms 
to complete, with this run taking almost 15 minutes to complete in total.
