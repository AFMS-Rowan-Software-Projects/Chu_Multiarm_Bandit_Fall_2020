Testing the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm against the Brute Force algorithm, within a 
controlled environment in which the channels all have the same stay failure rate, but only 
slightly different rates of stay success rate. This set of channels was run across both 
algorithms 1000 times in order to gauge how often each algorithm selected the best channels, 
or close to the best channel

Rigged 10 Channel environment, ran for 1000 Trials

Channel 0:	Stay Success:  0.46	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 1:	Stay Success:  0.47	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 2:	Stay Success:  0.48	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 3:	Stay Success:  0.49	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 4:	Stay Success:  0.50	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 5:	Stay Success:  0.51	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 6:	Stay Success:  0.52	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 7:	Stay Success:  0.53	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 8:	Stay Success:  0.54	Stay Failure:  0.5
Channel 9:	Stay Success:  0.55	Stay Failure:  0.5

Results:
Numbers next to Channel #: are out times chosen out of 1000 runs

			Epsilon Greedy		Brute Force Algo

Channel 8: 			4			153	
Channel 7: 			6			127	
Channel 6: 			11			111	
Channel 5: 			19			105	
Channel 4: 			32			89

Channel 0:			446			40

Epsilon Greedy seems to heavily favor the first few channels within a set, which is very problematic considering it wasnâ€™t even close to identifying the correct best channel.
