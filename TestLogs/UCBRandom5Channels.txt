Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm has now been implemented, the algorithm initially will explore 
each channel in order to gain initial information, then it will decide which channel to explore 
based on how they are uncertain about a channels outcome, if there is still uncertainty about
the channel, it will be chosen again until it below a threshold. UCB is an optimistic algorithm,
if we are uncertain about a channel, we should assume that it could be the correct channel.

Random 5 Channel environment, ran for 100 Trials

Channel 0:	Stay Success:  0.7308781907032909	Stay Failure:  0.41008081149220166
Channel 1:	Stay Success:  0.20771484130971707	Stay Failure:  0.3327170559595112
Channel 2:	Stay Success:  0.9677559094241207	Stay Failure:  0.006117182265761301
Channel 3:	Stay Success:  0.9637047970232077	Stay Failure:  0.9398653887819098
Channel 4:	Stay Success:  0.9471949176631939	Stay Failure:  0.9370821488959696

Results:
Best Channel was found to be Channel 2,
with a final success rate of 96.29%

The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm was successful in differentiating the between the 5 
random channels. Based on the set of channels above we can see that channels 2-4 have relatively 
similar chances of staying within a success state, however what differentiates channel 2 from the rest
is its ability to return to that success state with a very high probability following a failure,
whereas channels 3 and 4 were much more likely to remain stuck within the failure state. This shows
that the algorithm is not only capable of identifying the channel that stays successful most of the 
time, but also the channel that when a failure does occur, is able to return to a successful state 
quickly.
